# Meterological Dataset Variables ***variable: description
PFT:"Plant Functional Type"
PAR:"Photosynthetically Active Radiation = Input to L4C; PAR is the energy in those wavelengths of light (from the sun) that activate photosynthesis"
FPAR:"Fraction of PAR absorbed = Input to L4C; fraction of total PAR absorbed by green vegetation"
APAR:"Absorbed PAR = Calculated from PAR and FPAR as: PAR*FPAR; this quantity is what drives photosynthesis"
SMSF:"Surface Soil Moisture = Amount of moisture in the soil at the surface (approx. 0-5 cm depth)"
SMRZ:"Root-Zone Soil Moisture =  Amount of moisture in the soil at the root zone (i.e., able to be received by plant roots)"
TSOIL:"Soil Temperature"
TSURF:"Surface Temperature"
TMIN:"Minimum Air Temperature"

PAW:"Plant Available Water"
# Flux Tower/Reference Variables ***variable: description
GPP:"Gross Primary Production = Amount of carbon absorbed by plants"
RECO:"Ecosystem Respiration = Total respiration from plants and soil; calculated as: NEE+GPP or as Rh+Ra (equivalent)"
NEE:"Net Ecosystem Exchange:  Balance of carbon absorbed by plants versus carbon released by plants and soil; if positive, represents net carbon flux to atmosphere"
