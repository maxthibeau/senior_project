# Meterological Dataset Variables ***variable: description
PFT:Plant Functional Type
PAR:Photosynthetically Active Radiation = Input to L4C; PAR is the energy in those wavelengths of light (from the sun) that activate photosynthesis
FPAR:Fraction of PAR absorbed = Input to L4C; fraction of total PAR absorbed by green vegetation
APAR:Absorbed PAR = Calculated from PAR and FPAR as: PAR*FPAR; this quantity is what drives photosynthesis
SMSF:Surface Soil Moisture = Amount of moisture in the soil at the surface (approx. 0-5 cm depth)
SMRZ:Root-Zone Soil Moisture =  Amount of moisture in the soil at the root zone (i.e., able to be received by plant roots)
TSOIL:Soil Temperature
TSURF:Surface Temperature
TMIN:Minimum Air Temperature
FT:Freeze/Thaw State
VPD:Vapor Pressure Deficit
PAW:Plant Available Water
# Flux Tower/Reference Variables ***variable: description
GPP:Gross Primary Production = Amount of carbon absorbed by plants
RECO:Ecosystem Respiration = Total respiration from plants and soil; calculated as NEE+GPP or as Rh+Ra (equivalent)
NEE:Net Ecosystem Exchange = Balance of carbon absorbed by plants versus carbon released by plants and soil; if positive, represents net carbon flux to atmosphere

EBF:Evergreen Broadleaf (example - Wild Ginger)
DNF:Deciduous Needleleaf (example - European Larch Trees)

LUEmax:float,Light-Use Efficiency = the upper limit on light-use efficiency for a given PFT. Limiting environmental conditions reduce LUE from this theoretical upper limit, 0.00
TMIN_min:Minimum Air Temperature (Minimum of) reported in Kelvin
TMIN_max:Minimum Air Temperature (Maximum of) reported in Kelvin
VPD_min:Lower bound on Vapor Pressure Deficit ramp function
VPD_max:Upper bound on Vapor Pressure Deficit ramp function
SMRZ_min:Lower bound on Soil Moisture Root Zone ramp function
SMRZ_max:Upper bound on Soil Moisture Root Zone ramp function
FT:Multiplier for frozen conditions
FT_min:Multiplier for frozen conditions (Minimum of)
FT_max:Multiplier for frozen conditions (Maximum of)
SMSF_min:Lower bound on Soil Moisture SurFace ramp function
SMSF_max:Upper bound on Soil Moisture SurFace ramp function
Tsoil_beta0:Measurement 1 of parameter for controlling the response of soil microbes to temperature
Tsoil_beta1:Measurement 2 of parameter for controlling the response of soil microbes to temperature
Tsoil_beta2:Measurement 3 of parameter for controlling the response of soil microbes to temperature
Faut:Autotrophic Respiration Fraction = fraction of GPP used in autotrophic (plant) respiration
fmet:Fraction of litterfall that enters the metabolic (fast) SOC pool
fstr:Fraction of SOC in the metabolic (fast) pool that enters the structural (medium) SOC pool
kopt:Metabolic SOC pool is also referred to as the fast pool; it is the rate at which litterfall (leaves,stems) decay
kstr:Decay rate for the structural SOC (or medium) pool is expressed as a ratio to Ropt, i.e., the decay rate is: kstr/Ropt
kslw:Decay rate for the recalcitrant SOC (or slow) pool is expressed as a ratio to Ropt, i.e., the decay rate is: krec/Ropt
